## Blinkit Analysis Dashboard 

The objective of this project was to analyze sales performance,customer satisfaction and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using Power BI. 
The dashboard provided data-driven insights by leveraging KPIs, interactive visualizations and advanced analytics.

Key Business Requirements & Metrics
1.	Total Sales by Fat Content:
o	Identify sales distribution based on fat content (Low, Medium, High) to understand customer preferences for healthy vs. high-fat products.
o	Visualization: Donut Chart for fat content breakdown.
2.	Total Sales by Item Type:
o	Compare sales performance across different item categories (e.g., Beverages, Dairy, Snacks, Packaged Foods).
o	Visualization: Funnel Chart to highlight demand trends.
3.	Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:
o	Analyze how fat content distribution varies by outlet and its impact on sales.
o	Visualization: Clustered Bar Chart to compare fat content sales across outlets.
4.	Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year:
o	Evaluate sales performance based on how long an outlet has been in operation (e.g., newly established vs. older outlets).
o	Visualization: Line Chart for sales trends by establishment year.
5.	Sales by Outlet Size:
o	Measure total sales based on outlet size (Small, Medium, Large) to assess how store size impacts revenue.
o	Visualization: Bar Chart for outlet size vs. sales.
6.	Sales by Outlet Location:
o	Compare sales performance across different locations (Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural).
o	Visualization: Map or Bar Chart to highlight location-based sales trends.
7.	All Metrics by Outlet Type:
o	Analyze all key metrics (sales, fat content, item type, outlet size, and location) grouped by outlet type (e.g., Supermarket, Grocery Store, Hypermarket).
o	Visualization: Table + Filters (Slicers) for in-depth analysis.

Power BI Approach & Solution:
•	Created an interactive dashboard with KPIs and real-time insights.
•	Used DAX formulas for calculated metrics and trend analysis.
•	Implemented slicers to filter data dynamically by outlet type, item category, and fat content.
